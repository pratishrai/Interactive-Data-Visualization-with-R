I have done the following exercise from chapter 2:

In viz.aligned we showed a ggplot with a scatterplot panel on the left and a time series panel on the right. Make another version of the data visualization with the time series panel on the left and the scatterplot panel on the right.

I have used the same plot which was there in the manual but I have replaced the time range of (1970-1975) with (2000-2005) for the scatterplot.
